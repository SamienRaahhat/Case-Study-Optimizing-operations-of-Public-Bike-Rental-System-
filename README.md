In this case study, we develop a predictive model to predict the Rented Bike Count in a town called Kashipur in India.

## Optimizing operations of Public Bike Rental System in Kashipur ##

### Problem Statement: ###
The municipal corporation of Kashipur is operating a public bike rental system to promote environment-friendly mobility within the city. The system currently faces challenges in optimally distributing the fleet of rental bikes to match demand across different locations and time periods. There are instances of under or oversupply during certain hours, resulting in user dissatisfaction and operational inefficiencies.
Historical usage data and external factors like weather and holidays can be used to accurately forecast hourly bike rental demand for all dock stations to manage fleet operations and provide a good user experience. This will help choose fleet size and rebalancing strategies.


### Objectives:
•	Analyze historical rental transactions, weather and calendar data to understand demand patterns.
•	Develop an accurate predictive model based on the given dataset.
•	Identify key factors influencing demand and quantify their impact.
•	Recommend optimal fleet sizing and rebalancing strategies to meet demand.

### Dataset Description: ###
The dataset contains these attributes for historical rental transactions from bike stations in Kashipur over 2018-2020. 
•	Date: Date in yyyy-mm-dd format
•	Rented Bike Count: Number of bikes rented at each hour
•	Hour: Hour of the day (0-23)
•	Temperature: Air temperature in degrees Celsius
•	Humidity: Relative humidity in percentage (%)
•	Windspeed: Wind speed in meters/second (m/s)
•	Visibility: Visibility range in 10 meter increments
•	Dew Point Temperature: Dew point temperature in degrees Celsius
•	Solar Radiation: Solar radiation in Mega Joules per square meter (MJ/m2)
•	Rainfall: Rainfall amount in millimeters (mm)
•	Snowfall: Snowfall amount in centimeters (cm)
•	Season: Categorical variable (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn)
•	Holiday: Categorical variable (Holiday, Non-holiday)
•	Functional Day: Categorical variable (NoFunc, Fun) to distinguish functional vs non-functional hours.
The overarching goal is to enhance mobility services for citizens through optimized rental bike fleet management.
